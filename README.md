## Intro
  Burger time is a website that demonstrates sql and node's ability to act as a backend and databse to store user inputs. On the main page
  users will be given a list of available burger recipies, if the burger has not been eaten then it will appear on the left, if it has
  been eaten it will appear on the right with an option to either 'Devour it!' or 'Cook It!' respectivly. when the user clicks either butt-
  -on a query will be sent to the database and update whether it has been eaten or not and the option will move to the opposite list.
   If users want to make a custom butger order they can click the 'ADD A BURGER' button to go to the new burger form page. Here the user
  will have options for how much cheese they want, numbe rof patties, and a list of toppings. If the user wants more toppings they can
  click the '+ ADD TOPPING' button to add another topping list. The burgers become unruly and excessive after five toppings so I limited
  the amount of times a User can add toppings to 5. Once the order is complete the user can click 'SUBMIT' and the main page will be up-
  dated with the new burger on the list.
